## Notes on versioning and releases

- We use **SemVer**:
  - **MAJOR** – breaking schema/OpenAPI changes
  - **MINOR** – backward-compatible additions
  - **PATCH** – clarifications, docs, tooling
- Versions are driven by git tags via `setuptools_scm`. Tag `vX.Y.Z` to release.
- Docs are deployed per version tag and aliased to **latest**.
- Sample commands:

```shell
# if deleting is required
git tag -d v0.9.0
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.9.0
# adding a tag example
git tag v0.9.0 -m "0.9.0"
git push origin v0.9.0
```
